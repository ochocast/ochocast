## Description

The frontend of the streaming platform.

The frontend of an application refers to the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) components that users interact with directly. It's the part of the software that runs on the client side, meaning it's executed in the user's web browser or device.

## Installation and requirements

Once you have set up the database and the keycloak, you must not forget to set up the environment variables in a .env file.
You can copy the file “/frontend/.env.example” into a new “.env” file in the frontend folder.

Now you can proceed to run the frontend and the backend (you can run both at once from the root of the project).

From the folder “frontend”, if you have not yet installed the necesssary dependencies, run:

### `npm install`

Then you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Documentation

### `npm run doc`

Create a typedoc documentation folder for backend in backend/docs

### Open documentation

## `cd docs/ && open index.html`

###  How to document code example:

```js
/**
 * Starts the application with given options
 * @param options options to start the application with
 * @param app the application to start
 * @returns a promise resolved true when the application is ready
 */
declare function startApplication(app: FooApplication, options: FooOptions): Promise<boolean>

```
